Runs a modified Othello game of two random players, and then a game of a
random player vs a minimax player. If you want to change the width/height of
the board, edit the board_hw variable to an appropriate integer.
If you want to edit the depth of the minimax cutoff, change the depth_limit
variable to an appropriate number.
